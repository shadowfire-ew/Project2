some thoughts on how i will approach training on this data

i will go through the entire dataset per epoch
save the output and target to list for each slice
compute the cost and backpropogate at the end of the epoch
delete the output/target list
start new epoch at begining of dataset

would this be faster/easier in c/c++?
